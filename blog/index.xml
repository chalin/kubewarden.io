Its main goal is to allow you to write, test, distribute and run policies using the tooling that you already know and master, with a focus on controlling Kubernetes inner behaviors.
Policies are written in one of the supported languages, and the target object is a WebAssembly binary artifact. This is how Kubewarden can ensure that no matter where you built the policy, it can run on all platforms without any kind of adaptation.</description></item></channel></rss>
