At Kubewarden we have an ongoing effort to replace the Pod Security Policies with small, targeted Kubewarden policies.
Up until now, we have implemented some policies that replace some Pod Security Policies:</description></item><item><title>Introducing kwctl to Kubernetes Administrators</title><link>/blog/2021/06/kwctl-intro-for-kubernetes-administrators/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021/06/kwctl-intro-for-kubernetes-administrators/</guid><description>We are pleased to announce the availability of a new tool within the Kubewarden project: kwctl.
kwctl is a command line utility designed to help both policy authors and Kubernetes administrators.
This blog post focuses on the user experience of Kubernetes administrators. Future ones will cover the policy developer side of the story.
A Real-World Example: Controlling Container Capabilities The main character of today&amp;rsquo;s story is Alice. Alice is a Kubernetes administrator who wants to keep her Kubernetes cluster secure.</description></item><item><title>Writing your first policy with Kubewarden</title><link>/blog/2021/06/writing-your-first-policy-with-kubewarden/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021/06/writing-your-first-policy-with-kubewarden/</guid><description>Kubewarden is a project focused on security and compliance. Its main goal is to allow you to write, test, distribute and run policies using the tooling that you already know and master, with a focus on controlling Kubernetes inner behaviors.
Policies are written in one of the supported languages, and the target object is a WebAssembly binary artifact. This is how Kubewarden can ensure that no matter where you built the policy, it can run on all platforms without any kind of adaptation.</description></item></channel></rss>
